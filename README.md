# Develop

A minimalistic _Node.js_ module has been set in order to make the development process easier.

Assuming already have [_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) and _NPM_ (Node Package Manager, should come with _Node.js_) installed, navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the current repository and execute:
```cmd
npm install
```
This will install `live-server` _Node.js_ package, which will open the website in your default browser and reload it each time you modify any file (on save).

To bring up the development local server described above, navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the current repository and execute:
```cmd
npm run dev
```
Happy coding!
